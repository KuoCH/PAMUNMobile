                  Aaron is a 2nd year majoring in Accounting at National Taiwan University. He attended his first MUN conference, HSMUN 2013, at the end of senior year in high school and eagerly joined NTUMUN upon entering college. Later that year, he had an exhilarating experience at PAMUN 2013 as a delegate of WHO. He sees MUN as an ideal platform to debate important global issues with others. This passion stems from his childhood, when he lived in the United States of America, Singapore, Vietnam, and Australia in addition to Taiwan. This gave him a strong understanding of intercountry cultural differences, forced him to reevaluate beliefs and values he acquired in Taiwan, and also encouraged him to analyze contemporary issues from multiple viewpoints. Aaron hopes PAMUN 2014 will be just as great an experience for you as it was for him!
